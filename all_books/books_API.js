But a bid war is only marginally less lethal than a labyrinth, especially when it’s being run by a shady character who seems to know more than he lets on. And that’s the least of the poor S-rank’s worries. With Brod back around, class is about to be back in session, and it’s looking to be the hardest course in brutality Luciel’s ever taken.
